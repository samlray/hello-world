# hello-world
There are two assets in this folder:

1. indoorlte-1.0-release.apk
	This is the Android app .apk. You can install the app from this apk, but you must 
	first check the box to allow apps from 'unknown sources' that can be found in your 
	phones settings (location depends on phone).
	
2. IndoorLTE3a
	This file was exported from AndroidStudio and contains the whole projects source code.
	You can import this file back into AndroidStudio to add or change the source code. You 
	can also rebuild the app and generate a new .apk file, from which you can install the 
	app onto an Android device.
